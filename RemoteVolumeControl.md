# Remote Volume Control - Mobile Application Specification

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements, functionalities, and technical specifications for the "Remote Volume Control" mobile application, designed for Android devices. The application will allow users to remotely control the volume of a target device (e.g., a smart TV, audio receiver, etc.) from their Android mobile device.

## 2. Goals

*   Provide a user-friendly interface for remote volume control.
*   Ensure seamless and reliable connection to target devices.
*   Offer a secure communication protocol for data transfer.
*   Implement smooth and responsive volume adjustments.
*   Maintain compatibility with a wide range of Android devices and target systems.

## 3. Key Functionalities

### 3.1 Device Discovery

*   **Automatic Discovery:** The app should automatically scan and list available target devices on the local network.
*   **Manual IP Entry:** Allow users to manually enter the IP address of the target device if automatic discovery fails.
*   **Device Naming:** Allow users to assign custom names to discovered devices for easier identification.
*   **Device Listing:** Display a list of discovered devices, showing their name, IP address, and connection status.

### 3.2 Volume Control

*   **Volume Up/Down:** Dedicated buttons to increase or decrease the target device's volume.
*   **Mute/Unmute:** A button to toggle the mute state of the target device.
*   **Volume Level Display:** Display the current volume level of the target device on the app interface.
*   **Fine-grained Control:** Allow for precise volume adjustments, not just large jumps.
* **Visual Feedback**: Provide visual feedback on volume changes and mute/unmute states.

### 3.3 Connection Management

*   **Connection Establishment:** Facilitate a stable and reliable connection to the target device.
*   **Connection Status:** Display the connection status (connected, disconnected, connecting) clearly.
*   **Automatic Reconnection:** Attempt automatic reconnection if the connection is lost.
*   **Multiple Devices:** Allow the user to connect to, and control, multiple devices.
*   **Device Selection**: Allow the user to switch between multiple connected devices.

## 4. Security Requirements

### 4.1 Network Security

*   **Secure Communication:** Implement encryption (e.g., TLS/SSL) for communication between the app and the target device.
*   **Authentication:** Implement a secure authentication mechanism (e.g., token-based) to prevent unauthorized access.
*   **Firewall Considerations:** Provide guidance to users on configuring firewalls to allow app communication.
* **Data Minimization:** Only transmit the minimum amount of necessary data.
* **Input Validation**: Ensure data coming from the server is correctly handled.

### 4.2 Application Security

*   **Data Storage:** Securely store any sensitive data (e.g., device credentials, connection details) using Android's secure storage mechanisms.
*   **Code Obfuscation:** Obfuscate the application code to deter reverse engineering.
*   **Regular Updates:** Provide regular updates to address security vulnerabilities.
* **Permission Handling**: Only request necessary permissions and explain why they are needed.

## 5. Technical Requirements

### 5.1 Platform

*   **Operating System:** Android (latest stable version and at least 2 major previous versions).
*   **Network:** Wi-Fi (primary) and Bluetooth (optional).

### 5.2 Communication Protocol

*   **Network Protocol:** TCP/IP or UDP.
* **Data format**: JSON or XML.
*   **API:** RESTful API for communication with the target device (if applicable).
*   **Discovery Protocol:** Bonjour/mDNS or similar for device discovery.

### 5.3 Development Environment

*   **IDE:** Android Studio.
*   **Language:** Kotlin (preferred) or Java.
*   **Libraries:** Appropriate networking and UI libraries.

### 5.4 User Interface

*   **Design:** Clean, modern, and intuitive design.
*   **Responsiveness:** Adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
*   **Accessibility:** Adhere to accessibility guidelines for users with disabilities.

### 5.5 Performance

*   **Responsiveness:** Quick response to user interactions.
*   **Resource Usage:** Efficient use of device resources (CPU, memory, battery).

## 6. Future Enhancements

*   **Preset Volume Levels:** Allow users to save and quickly access preset volume levels.
*   **Advanced Control:** Support additional remote control features (e.g., channel change, power on/off).
*   **Voice Control:** Integrate voice control for hands-free operation.
* **Bluetooth Support**: Support for Bluetooth connected devices.
